I dreamt i was free, for free to die none other will equal, how will the night pass my eyes staring bright into the sky, my face opens in cuts, wider my skins pulls and light into my heart, i know my mind is seperate from body, i know my mind is seperate from self, pioneering this ship, gifted to me and yet gratitudeâ€™s failure is my own. My world is broken. My world is time. Yell into the black no echoes.
