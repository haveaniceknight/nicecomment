i know everything i must accomplish to achieve my goals. yet i sit on my aspirations, lock them away in vaulted cells. how is it im presented with such oppurtunity, resource, potential, yet seize none of it? what is the sin that plagues me, i know of it. Me. I am the root. Reflect. I acre my downfalls, yet fail to reflect on my wins. Mindset, thats what determines me. I could view my situation as positive, focus on my wins and success, yet i decry my failures. I need to ride the stream of life, remember the stream? you knew it as a child? thinking of yourself as lucky, feeling in-tune and motivated with the world. Grab hold of it, ride the wave, let it pull you to success. Do you see the golden thread? reach out, grab it.
