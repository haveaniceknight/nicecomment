# truckers and ai
isn't it interesting that the consensus prediction for an ai job market takeover was: blue-collar first, white-collar second, creativity maybe never, yet it's gone in the opposite direction? humans have always viewed creativity as something "magical and unique," yet creativity is a natural aspect of neural nets and llm generation due to hallucination.

while one might argue that creativity involves emotion, culture, nuance, and personal experience beyond ai's comprehension or replication. this negates, and undermines, the significance of language to act as a vessel for human creativity.

language is a tool for abstracting our thoughts, and since llms are trained on 100’s of trillions of parameters, they can understand the essence of our emotions, nuances, and experiences, through inference. this is why llms understand satire, comedy, sarcasm, and the subtle written. this is also why llm’s have counter-intuitively become so profoundly confident at creative thought. yet struggle aggressively with simple tasks like driving down a busy winding street. the reason ai will achieve blue collar supremacy last and not first is the following:

abstraction makes difficult topics easy, which is why i'm able to write what i currently am. it's also why ai has developed so quickly. it can use the abstraction of experience to develop thought instead of parsing through the raw data itself.

a baby cannot speak english. a baby must decipher our world without language. it must comprehend vast amounts of visual and auditory input. the baby must make decisions based on this input. an ai designed to drive down roads must equate its learning cycle to the development of a baby.

an llm can skip this foundational step, and then abstract greater into our psyche - through language. this allows the rapid development we are seeing. yet remains the limiting factor for why llms will never be considered agi.

llms are the written summation of our consciousness. for an ai to replace the blue collar class, it must undergo experiences similar to a baby's, rapidly evolving and growing by interacting with the world through more than just words, but through all our senses.

its of my opinion that copy writers will hit the chopping block before truckers.
