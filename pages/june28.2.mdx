The garden of my imagination is starving in draught. The poetry of my thought is run bare and inkless. I want to find my body, my soul, connect to my spirituality. I am me, separate of mind and tissue, thoughts and mares. I need alone, fuzzy brain and warm peaches from the rain, i slipped rain juice once, posted on my head i cramped my notes. Illegible. I think good thoughts, i do, i promise. But sometimes i forget them, and so I never share.
