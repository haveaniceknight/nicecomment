I looked upon the mountains god asked me to climb,
how do you expect me to scale the mountain without a winter coat? I asked, 

what unfairness, what hardship, what hatred,
why me. 

Why would you ever think you deserve heaven without tasting hell first?

in my search for happiness i dug a whole to hell
