Can i fall back into you? will you catch me? blankets of time, washing me away, head back, wading with eyes in darkness, smiling in brightness, if i told you i saw heaven would you believe me? 

truly, who am i, lost and streaming, my mind breaking and flowing and ebbing

in the flowing wades of life. Will you reach out to me at the river bank, grab my hand, or lose me

when i close my eyes i see everything, truly
