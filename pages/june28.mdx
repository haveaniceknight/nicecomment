I feel my brain aging. My memory is not as sharp as it once was, im slower to grasp concepts, im less sparky in action, less impulsive, more tired, more beat, more worn, shaped from stone, yet how i wish to fall into sand, i dont want to lose myself, lost to tides of opinions and ideologies and bullshit from everyone and everything. 

I used to wake up every morning excited to start my day. Excited to read and write and play. Now i just sleep in. Its the saddest thing.  

Why is it that I can realize thoughts that can never be actualized. I can dream of fantasy worlds and kingdoms of fiction. If life is the congregate of survival instinct. If i have evolved through iron to become who I am. If all life and discovery is based on practicality and progression. What purpose does the fictitious imagination hold? How do dreams of dragons, lost kingdoms, and fairytales serve me? Does the implication that I have the tools to realize fiction; conversely imply that fiction surrounds me? That the immutable truths I hold are made of the same fabric that dragons and kingdoms arise from?

I wish I never learned to read and write. How raw my thoughts would be. How pure and uncorrupted. Every idea shaded a different color in my mind. Not bound, harsh and white, to the words of my language. Ideas without limitations. Ideas made of an Alphabet that does not rest at 26 characters. What are words? If not the poor tools created by poor men to express poor ideas. The meek impressions of thoughts, written. True ideas, raw ideas, passionate ideas. You feel them. Words, not necessary. English is not a language, but a mere imitation. Communication through heart and justice and emotion. That is language. That is truth. I wish i knew no words, so i could speak to you freely. If you cared to listen. Read my body and tone, my eyes and hands. I trust you would understand me all the same. And yet im imprisoned, trapped within the white and black letters of my poorly written thoughts. Look deeper than my words. I hope you see. Who i truly am. 

I wish one day to write something truly novel.
